hog .py runs the pedestrian detection on existing video. 

Give link of video in cap=cv2.VideoCapture(0) in place of VideoCapture

facerec.py and train.py are for face detection and recognition

first train the system with the faces you wanna recognise by train.py

then facerec.py for recognising trained faces and detecting all other

You'll need to install OpenCV 2 or 3 for the detection.
